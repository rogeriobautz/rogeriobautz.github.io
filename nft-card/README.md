## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about flexbox, overlay, media queries and inherit of some css properties.

I need a different opacity from eye icon on the overlay and i found a good solution using rgba on the parent-element. In this case, the child element does not inherit the opacity:

```css
.parent-element { rgba(13, 228, 221, 0) }
.child-element { opacity:0; }

/* The project requires a higher opacity for the child element */
.parent-element:hover { rgba(13, 228, 221, 0.4) }
.child-element:hover { opacity:.9; }
```

### Continued development

I will continue to study about CSS display and responsiveness and building web projects to practice and start a JavaScript Course

### Useful resources

- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified) - A really good channel to new web developers

- [Google](https://www.google.com/) - Just put your problem along with the stack there like "overlay opacity css" and you be in good hands.

- [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Very helpfull but you need to be careful because you will see a lot of responses that are outdated and you have to dig the best answer to your problem.
